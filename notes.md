# My Notes
_A place for my raw, authentic, and poorly written thoughts and ideas. The content is in order of recent to oldest._

A couple of projects I want to do. One is to improve economic understanding. I want for myself and other people
to be able to understand economic changes in the world. These could be through government policies, technological changes,
natural events, etc. I don't know how to achieve this, but I was thinking of a public economic simulator/model. Reading the MoM of
the state bank's meetings, I can tell they have a model using which they forecast things. The other one is to make it easier 
for people to consume news. This includes avoiding bias, avoiding slop, avoiding overload of info, etc. I don't know, it's actually super
hard to consume news properly. I don't know what/who to believe, and I sure as hell can't investigate myself. 
I am not well versed on the sources such that I can identify their unique biases. What would a solution for this look like? 
An AI news aggregator, deep research-like tools applied to news sources, augmenting news with social media stuff, etc.

There are a couple things that I know/have done which would be useful for young 
computer scientists or engineers (I think). What is the best way to do this? 
The goal here is not to teach something new, but to bring stuff into the awareness 
of young engineers. One of them is better served as a tech blog post. The other one I 
feel is better as a lecture. Maybe I do both. Interesting that I want to pass on this stuff.
A reason maybe that I may be the only person in the city that can "teach" certain stuff. 
For example, given that I built [OpenVoiceChat](https://github.com/Finity-Alpha/OpenVoiceChat) from scratch, I maybe the only person that can convey the tricks and
subtleties of building voice ai systems (probably not true). Same I feel is the case with data compression
from an AI perspective. Having attempted (poorly) the hutter prize and extensively studied 
data compression and how intelligence is compression, I may be the only person that can 
effectively distill the stuff or direct young engineer properly. Well, they can of course 
go and learn all this stuff themselves. The goal here is to add this to their awareness
such that there is a higher chance that they go and learn all this stuff themselves.

Researching and understanding things should be very accessible today, sifting through the internet and finding relevant information.
As part of work, I've been doing feasibility and technical implementation research (figuring out if a thing can be done, if so, how) 
and it's been very rewarding. It took me back to the school days where I would write reports on things citing all the sources and
giving a nice breakdown. At the time I felt I was actively adding to the knowledge base of people and myself. These weren't opinion 
pieces like the ones I write in my [blog](https://www.fakhirali.pk/myblog/), these are more like a compiled set of facts to serve a purpose.
This kind of writing is something I may be best suited for, idk. I feel, there is a real gain in knowledge and understanding this way.
Maybe I start a technical blog as well.I like [this](https://colah.github.io/) guy's work.

We need to get real money back. Fake fiat money means it can be manipulated easily. I don't know
how to solve this tho. Gold backed currency did fine. A currency pegged to human quality of life
improvements would nice to have. I proposed it to be pegged to kilowatts, but someone pointed out
that then everyone will be burning their carbon into the atmosphere. Does something like bitcoin
work? Doesn't seem like it.

Sharing revenue instead of "stocks". I am not a fan of the "raise money from investors" game. I propose a new investment+employment model.
Employees and investors of the organization share its revenue. The revenue is in proportion to the amount of money and value 
invested by the employee and investor. The revenue gets divided into percentages. Some of it can go back into the organization
for reinvestment. Some of it would be spent on costs of production (in hindsight this makes it profit sharing). When you are 
hiring a new employee everyone's percentage decreases since the new person would have to be paid in some percentage of the revenue. 
This way the org would be incentivized to hire people they think will grow the revenue in the future. 
This also makes the flow of value very direct (if one measures it in revenue). You would want the org to try to increase revenue 
rather than shareholder value. This sort of model may not be the best for large long term projects.

Why does sadapay and the e-wallets exist? Wouldn't all the founders get told "what happens when the banks make an app of their own?".
Banks have made apps of their own. Every bank has one. I still prefer sadapay over my banking app. My hypothesis is that banks
don't really know how to create a good application with a good user experience, they also probably don't care. Maybe an indication
that one should pursue startups that may seem like fragile because a big player could do it. If the big players don't care enough, 
it doesn't matter. Also if a big player hasn't already done it they probably don't care enough, otherwise they probably had the brains
and bread to do it (not sure if this holds true always).

Not a fan of the marketing, investor buzz lingo in AI. What is an agent? Tim Berners Lee mentioned "software agents" in 2001. 
Did we make "agentic" software then? Was it the year of agents in 2002? The investor, business, marketing game is not great.
There is a lot of not value creating things you can do that are considered "good". B2B space is not really efficient in this way. 
It's kinda like informal loose collusion.

Writing this makes me feel like this is so much better than talking to an LLM. I get to think, plan, introspect etc.
I don't have to read long responses with "balanced" explanations. An LLM reading this can be helpful. If I mention things
I need to do, adding them to my task backlog would be nice. Any unanswered questions can go to the "exploration" section 
for me to think about it more. Any long term goals or near future plans can be organized accordingly. This is much useful
to me than the "thinking w/ me" or "answering or leading my thoughts" mode. Do the manual for me. I don't want to end up in
LLM knowledge silo.

All my "product" ideas are things that would solve my problems. Here product equals things I should build. 
Are these "good" product ideas? Idk. They might be a good solution to **my** problem. But will they be 
something that people will pay for and use regularly? Idk. Should I build things that are "good" products or
productize my ideas? Just read the paul graham essay again. I think the answer is "problems that I have myself".
Also I am much more motivated to solve them than the other problems. I also have a good problem understanding. 
Building an AI time calendar/time-task management app. The AI voice note taking app was also something that solved
my own problem. I give up on these ideas because I haven't been able to get sales for them. I should be much more
patient with these. I should keep improving them consistently. OpenVoiceChat was a 1 year thing. Building good
things takes time, I should be patient.

Code and content is leverage in the modern world - naval. I should be producing both. Code I am doing with the product I am trying to build. Content is missing for now.
I should start streaming again. I should write more. Technical blogs might be my thing. I should do an experiment and write about it.
I should look at the blogs of the people I follow. The simon wilson blog is pretty cool. Andrej karpathy is great. I love geohot's blog. I should def write more.

I feel like there is a fundamental difference in how I make decisions and how they are commonly made. I need to formalize it somehow.
I dropped out because I felt I could learn everything on the internet. People go to university to get a degree.
I feel like I live my life as if the world is as it should be. You shouldn't need a degree to get a job if you can demonstrate skill.
However the world is mostly not how it should be. If I make my life's decisions based on how the world is or shouldn't be, my decisions are also not how they should be.
For the sake of making the correct decision I have to consider how things should be.
