# My Notes
_A place for my raw, authentic, and poorly written thoughts and ideas. The content is in order of recent to oldest._

I feel like there is a fundamental difference in how I make decisions and how they are commonly made. I need to formalize it somehow. I dropped out because I felt I could learn everything on the internet. People go to university to get a degree. I feel like I live my life as if the world is as it should be. You shouldn't need a degree to get a job if you can demonstrate skill. However the world is mostly not how it should be. If I make my life's decisions based on how the world is or shouldn't be, my decisions are also not how they should be. For the sake of making the correct decision I have to consider how things should be.
