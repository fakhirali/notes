# My Notes
_A place for my raw, authentic, and poorly written thoughts and ideas. The content is in order of recent to oldest._

All my "product" ideas are things that would solve my problems. Here product equals things I should build. 
Are these "good" product ideas? Idk. They might be a good solution to **my** problem. But will they be 
something that people will pay for and use regualarly? Idk. Should I build things that are "good" products or
productize my ideas? Just read the paul graham essay again. I think the answer is "problems that I have myself".
Also I am much more motivated to solve them than the other problems. I also have a good problem understanding. 
Building an AI time calendar/time-task management app. The AI voice note taking app was also something that solved
my own problem. I give up on these ideas because I havent been able to get sales for them. I should be much more
patient with these. I should keep improving them consistently. OpenVoiceChat was a 1 year thing. Building good
things take time, I should be patient.

Planning. Code and content is leverage in the modern world - naval. I should be producing both. Code I am doing with the product I am trying to build. Content is missing for now.
I should start streaming again. I should write more. Technical blogs might be my thing. I should do an experiment and write about it. I should look at the blogs of the people I follow. 
The simon wilson blog is pretty cool. Andrej karpathy is great. I love geohot's blog. I should def write more.

I feel like there is a fundamental difference in how I make decisions and how they are commonly made. I need to formalize it somehow. I dropped out because I felt I could learn everything on the internet. People go to university to get a degree. I feel like I live my life as if the world is as it should be. You shouldn't need a degree to get a job if you can demonstrate skill. However the world is mostly not how it should be. If I make my life's decisions based on how the world is or shouldn't be, my decisions are also not how they should be. For the sake of making the correct decision I have to consider how things should be.
