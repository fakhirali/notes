    <h1>My Notes</h1>
<p><em>A place for my raw, authentic, and poorly written thoughts and ideas. The content is in order of recent to oldest.</em></p>

<p>Planning. Code and content is leverage in the modern world - naval. I should be producing both. Code I am doing with the product I am trying to build. Content is missing for now.
I should start streaming again. I should write more. Technical blogs might be my thing. I should do an experiment and write about it. I should look at the blogs of the people I follow.
The simon wilson blog is pretty cool. Andrej karpathy is great. I love geohot's blog. I should def write more.</p>

<p>I feel like there is a fundamental difference in how I make decisions and how they are commonly made. I need to formalize it somehow. I dropped out because I felt I could learn everything on the internet. People go to university to get a degree. I feel like I live my life as if the world is as it should be. You shouldn't need a degree to get a job if you can demonstrate skill. However the world is mostly not how it should be. If I make my life's decisions based on how the world is or shouldn't be, my decisions are also not how they should be. For the sake of making the correct decision I have to consider how things should be.</p>
