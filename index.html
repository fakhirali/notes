    <h1>My Notes</h1>
<p><em>A place for my raw, authentic, and poorly written thoughts and ideas. The content is in order of recent to oldest.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>Writing this makes me feel like this is so much better than talking to an LLM. I get to think, plan, introspect etc.
I dont have to read long responses with "balanced" explanations. An LLM reading this can be helpful. If I mention things
I need to do, adding them to my task backlog would be nice. Any unanswered questions can go to the "exploration" section
for me to think about it more. Any long term goals or near future plans can be organzied accordingly. This is much useful
to me than the "thinking w/ me" or "answering or leading my thoughts" mode. Do the manual for me. I dont want to end up in
LLM knowledge silo.</p>
<hr />
<p>All my "product" ideas are things that would solve my problems. Here product equals things I should build.
Are these "good" product ideas? Idk. They might be a good solution to <strong>my</strong> problem. But will they be
something that people will pay for and use regualarly? Idk. Should I build things that are "good" products or
productize my ideas? Just read the paul graham essay again. I think the answer is "problems that I have myself".
Also I am much more motivated to solve them than the other problems. I also have a good problem understanding.
Building an AI time calendar/time-task management app. The AI voice note taking app was also something that solved
my own problem. I give up on these ideas because I havent been able to get sales for them. I should be much more
patient with these. I should keep improving them consistently. OpenVoiceChat was a 1 year thing. Building good
things take time, I should be patient.</p>
<hr />
<p>Planning. Code and content is leverage in the modern world - naval. I should be producing both. Code I am doing with the product I am trying to build. Content is missing for now.
I should start streaming again. I should write more. Technical blogs might be my thing. I should do an experiment and write about it. I should look at the blogs of the people I follow.
The simon wilson blog is pretty cool. Andrej karpathy is great. I love geohot's blog. I should def write more.</p>
<hr />
<p>I feel like there is a fundamental difference in how I make decisions and how they are commonly made. I need to formalize it somehow. I dropped out because I felt I could learn everything on the internet. People go to university to get a degree. I feel like I live my life as if the world is as it should be. You shouldn't need a degree to get a job if you can demonstrate skill. However the world is mostly not how it should be. If I make my life's decisions based on how the world is or shouldn't be, my decisions are also not how they should be. For the sake of making the correct decision I have to consider how things should be.</p>
